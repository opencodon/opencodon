AI Agent Runner with Tool Calling

This module provides a clean, standalone agent that can execute AI models
with tool calling capabilities. It handles the conversation loop, tool execution,
and response management.

Features:
- Automatic tool calling loop until completion
- Configurable model parameters
- Error handling and recovery
- Message history management
- Support for multiple model providers

Usage:
    from opencodon.core.run_agent import AIAgent
    
    agent = AIAgent(base_url="http://localhost:30000/v1", model="claude-opus-4-20250514")
    response = agent.run_conversation("Tell me about the latest Python updates")
