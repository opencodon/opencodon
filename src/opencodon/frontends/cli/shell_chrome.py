opencodon CLI - Interactive Terminal Interface

A beautiful command-line interface for opencodon, inspired by Claude Code.
Features ASCII art branding, interactive REPL, toolset selection, and rich formatting.

Usage:
    python cli.py                          # Start interactive mode with all tools
    python cli.py --toolsets web,terminal  # Start with specific toolsets
    python cli.py --skills opencodon-dev,github-auth
    python cli.py --list-tools             # List available tools and exit

        Unlike _force_full_redraw, we do NOT clear the physical screen or
        scrollback here.  The startup banner and tool summary are printed
        before prompt_toolkit owns the live chrome, so they live in normal
        terminal scrollback.  Erasing the screen on SIGWINCH removes that
        startup UI and ``_shell._replay_output_history`` cannot reconstruct it
        (the banner was never added to ``_OUTPUT_HISTORY``).

        Let prompt_toolkit's own resize path run with its renderer cursor
        cache intact. Its Application._on_resize() starts with
        renderer.erase(leave_alternate_screen=False), which needs the cached
        cursor position to move back to the live prompt origin before
        erase_down(). Resetting the renderer before that erase loses the
        origin and can leave stale prompt glyphs after a narrow resize.

        We also flag ``_status_bar_suppressed_after_resize`` so the dynamic
        status bar and input separator rules stay hidden while the terminal
        reflow settles.  On column shrink the terminal reflows already-rendered
        status bar rows into scrollback before prompt_toolkit can erase them;
        drawing a fresh full-width bar immediately makes the old and new
        versions look duplicated (#19280, #22976).

        Suppression alone is not enough on a WIDTH change.  prompt_toolkit's
        ``renderer.erase()`` does ``cursor_up(_cursor_pos.y)`` + ``erase_down()``
        using the ``_cursor_pos.y`` cached from the LAST render at the OLD
        width (renderer.py).  When the column count shrinks, the terminal
        reflows each already-painted full-width chrome row into 2+ physical
        rows, so the cached ``y`` undershoots: ``cursor_up`` does not climb
        past the reflowed rows and ``erase_down`` leaves the stale bar stranded
        ABOVE the live origin.  The next paint then stacks a fresh bar below it
        — the duplicated-status-bar report (two bars, two elapsed readings).
        Suppression hides the *new* bar but never erases the already-reflowed
        *old* one, so the ghost survives the whole suppression window.

        Fix: on a width change, wipe the visible viewport with ``erase_screen``
        (CSI 2J) BEFORE delegating to prompt_toolkit's resize, then let its
        repaint redraw from a clean origin.  This is banner-safe: 2J clears
        only the visible screen, NOT scrollback history (that is CSI 3J, which
        we do not send here — ``rebuild_scrollback=False``), so the startup
        banner that scrolled into history is preserved and
        ``_shell._replay_output_history`` is not needed.  Row-count-only changes skip
        the clear (no reflow, so no ghost) to avoid an unnecessary repaint.

        The suppression is transient: a short follow-up timer clears it and
        repaints once the reflow has settled, so the bar returns on its own
        during idle.  Previously the flag was only cleared on the next
        *submitted* user input, so a resize/reflow (tmux pane change, SSH
        window restore, font zoom) followed by idle left the status bar hidden
        indefinitely even while the refresh clock kept ticking (the dynamic
        chrome rendered at height 0 on every repaint).  The next-submit clear
        at the input loop remains as a fast path.
